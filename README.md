# Forward
This is a project about graduation thesis.

## sys/sys.src
Include all verilog sources files about constructing a SoC and simulation files on it.

## backend
Include all documents about how to transfer the user-defined ISA on llvm backend.

## pics
Include all description pictures used in markdown files.

# LLVM
Include steps how to modify the llvm source files, for the purpose that enable the llvm compiler to compile c language on the new target machine.
